The Investment Checklist

p2 The best investment opportunities usually come in big waves, such
as when entire markets decline.

p 6 To understand where current bubbles exist, ask, “Where is a lot of
money being made very quickly?” Look at the Forbes magazine list of

p 18 Brad Leonard founded BML Capital Management, LLC in
2004. He has compounded capital at a rate of 26.94 percent, net
after fees from 2004 to 2010, compared to 3.87 percent, net for the
S&P 500. He credits this record to being disciplined about paying
low prices for stocks. He typically pays three times enterprise value
(EV) to EBITDA for a stock, and he prefers to buy businesses that do
not need a lot of capital expenditures to maintain their businesses
and those that have little to no debt. In 2009, when the stock mar-
ket was declining, Leonard was buying stocks at one to two times
EBITDA. Leonard says, “When you are paying one or two times EV
EBITDA, not much needs to go right. If the business survives, you
win. As long as the business does not end, you don’t need to make a
lot of great assumptions in your analysis. If instead I were paying a 5
percent earnings yield (earnings divided by market capitalization) on
depressed earnings, it would not really be that cheap.”
