Problem Solve 101
Ken Watanabe

p 13 Problem solving is a process that can be broken down into four steps:
(1) understand the current situation;
(2) identify the root cause of the problem;
(3) develop an effective action plan; and
(4) execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.

p 39 If you start coleecting and analysing data without first clarifying the question you are trying to answer, you're probably doing yourself more harm than good. You'll end up drowning in a flood of information and realise only later that most of that research was a waste of time.
