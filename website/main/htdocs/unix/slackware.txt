# SBOPKG
Download dir: /usr/cach/sbopkg
For dependencies resolution:
	sqg -a
is part of sbopkg and will generate files in
	/var/lib/sbopkg/queues/*.sqf
It takes a long time to run, but it knows about
subdependencies. To install, you use a "queue", e.g.
	sbopkg -i ffmpeg
or
	sbopkg -i blender
which installs into /opt/blender. vlc is also available.
But perhaps a better way is to use slackbuilds.
