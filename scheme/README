LALR PARSER

Bigloo has an excellent LALR parser - you can see it in operation in my
directory sc/scpt. Bigloo seems to produce very large executables, though. 
scpt was about 1.3M in size using cygwin.

Chicken's LALR parser looks much less nice than bigloo's.

A portable and quite nice looking parser (but I haven' used it) is 
available at:
