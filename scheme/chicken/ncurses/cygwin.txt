INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING NCURSES ON CYGWIN

The fundamental problem is that cygwin seems to put ncurses in a non-standard directory (maybe it would be better to re-compile ncurses from source), which messes up the installation.

To help circumvent this, I have downloaded the source and put it in this directory. You now ought to be able to do:
  cd cygwin-src 
  chicken-install

INSTALLING NCURSES FROM SCRATCH


Download the egg sources (which you'll need to modify them):
  chicken-install -r ncurses
  cd ncurses

Edit ncurses.scm so that
  #include <ncurses.h>
reads
  #include <ncurses/ncurses.h>

Install the egg from the ncurses directory:
  chicken-install
