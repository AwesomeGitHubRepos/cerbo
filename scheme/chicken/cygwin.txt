INSTALLING CHICKEN ON CYGWIN

Felix asked me to try compiling the latest version of chicken from
git. I am happy to announce that it all goes very well - expect for
the command chicken-install - which seems to be a Win7/Vista
problem. Here's a more detailed report of what I did:

I installed a fresh copy of cygwin - ensuring that chicken 3.4.0 was
NOT included in the installation. I then performed the following
actions:
git clone http://chicken.wiki.br/git/chicken-core.git
cd chicken-core
make PLATFORM=cygwin confclean
make PLATFORM=cygwin PREFIX=/usr/local bootstrap
make PLATFORM=cygwin PREFIX=/usr/local CHICKEN=./chicken-boot
make PLATFORM=cygwin PREFIX=/usr/local install
cd ..
csi

csi worked successfully. I obtained the output
CHICKEN

I also confirm that csc compiles a file correctly.

FYI, the git commit from which chicken was built is:

Installation of eggs proved problematical:
chicken-install loop
bash: /usr/local/bin/chicken-install: Permission denied

To overcome this, I did:
cp /usr/local/bin/chicken-install.exe /usr/local/bin/chickeni.exe

It is then possible to do:
chickeni loop
csi
> (use loop)
