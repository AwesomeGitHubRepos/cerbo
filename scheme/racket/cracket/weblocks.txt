The safest bet is to upgrade to the latest version of of SBCL:
   http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html
Version 1.0.42 is known to work with weblocks. Install as root:
   INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local sh install.sh
Ensure your PATH is set to pick up the installed version of sbcl.

For those wanting to to use weblocks on Fedora 8 (e.g. on Amazon's EC2), you will need to install libssl:
   yum install openssl-devel

Obtain the latest version of quicklisp (as at 29-Sep-2010):
   wget http://quickstart.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp

An explanatory video is available at:
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11wYPAy9qNw
The details of that video are below.

Start sbcl, and type the following commands:
   (load "quicklisp.lisp")
   (quicklisp-quickstart:install)

Some explanatory text is displayed by quicklisp:
    To load a system, use: (ql:quickload "system-name")
    To list systems, use (ql:system-list) or (ql:system-apropos "term")
    To load quicklisp every time you start Lisp, use (ql:add-to-init-file)
    For more documentation of this demo, see http://www.quicklisp.org/demo/
This information might be useful later.

Install weblocks from within sbcl:
   (ql:quickload "weblocks" :prompt t)
Have a little patience, as it takes some time for everything to compile.

Now is a good time to save your image:
   (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "weblocks.core")
On my machine, the image is 60M in size. Ouch! 

You can restart this image using a command like:
   rlwrap sbcl --core weblocks.core
rlwrap is a very good command which gives you readline for those programs which don't have it. It is well worth installing on your system.

To see weblocks in action, type:
   (weblocks:start-weblocks)

Point your browser to:
   http://localhost:8080
and you should see a weclome message from Weblocks.

To stop weblocks, type:
   (weblocks:stop-weblocks)
