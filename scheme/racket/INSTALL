Installation notes on various systems

* FEDORA 8, EC2, GIT, 2010-10-12
Simple in-place installation: I just want to see if it compiles and runs
Date: 12-Oct-2010
   yum install git gcc
   git clone http://github.com/plt/racket.git
   ./configure
... lib/cpp fails sanity check
   yum install glibc-headers # :(
   yum groupinstall "Development Tools" # :) better - should prolly start here !
   yum install libX11-devel 
   yum install libXt-devel
   yum install libXext-devel
   yum install libXmu-devel
   yum install libXaw-devel
... OK. Maybe the following will be quicker: yum groupinstall "X Software Development"
   make
... compile was successful
   make install
... gets a long way, and then starts spitting out messages like:
default-load-handler: cannot open input file: "/root/racket/collects/sgl/gl-info.rkt" (No such file or directory; errno=2)
Later ...
raco setup:  in scribblings/reference
debug2: client_check_window_change: changed
debug2: channel 0: request window-change confirm 0
... EC2 is extremely slow, and eventually ended with
raco setup: rendering: unstable/scribblings/unstable.scrbl
make[1]: *** [install-3m] Killed
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/racket/src'
make: *** [install] Error 2





* SLACKWARE 13.1, RACKET 5.0.1 FAILS TO BUILD, 2010-10-12
It gives: *** [wxJPEG.o] Error 1
I have reported it as bug 11289: http://bit.ly/8ZltBP 
  http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=11289
I think it might be due to the fact that Slackware 13.1 uses libpng v 1.4, whereas Racket
expects v 1.2
Update 07-Oct-2010: This has apparently been fixed by commit 2d378775fcce9dfd765560340e22ff30bda74f4b:
   http://bit.ly/a1ZfLJ
Update 08-Oct-2010: I was able to obtain a completely successful compile from
   git clone http://github.com/plt/racket.git
   

* UBUNTU 10.10, EC2, RACKET 5.0.1, 2010-10-20
