scpt - sc parser tree

Generates an AST (Abstract Sytnax Tree) for sc (spreadsheet program) files.
The output is an sexp.

REQUIREMENTS

Needs the Bigloo Scheme compiler


BUILDING AND INSTALLING

See the INSTALL file

EXAMPLE

Included in this directory is an example sc file called `test'. Here's what
it looks like:

--- test begin ---
# This data file was generated by the Spreadsheet Calculator.
# You almost certainly shouldn't edit it.

leftstring A0 = "LEFTY"
rightstring B0 = "RIGHTY"
leftstring C0 = "MI"
let A1 = 12
let B1 = A1*2+3
goto B1 A0
--- test end ---

To perform the parsing, type in a command such as
   scpt <test >result

The output will look like:
--- result begin ---
((leftstring (cell 1 0) "LEFTY") (rightstring (cell 2 0) "RIGHTY") (leftstring (cell 3 0) "MI") (let (cell 1 1) 12) (let (cell 2 1) (add (mul (cell 1 1) 2) 3)) . #f)
--- result end ---

You can then process the sexpr in Scheme by doing a (read) and processing
the list.


CELLS

The keyword `cell' has the form `cell c r' for column C and row R. 
Note that C >= 1, and R >= 0!!
