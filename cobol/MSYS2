Building on MSYS2

pacman -S tar lzip make ncurses-devel

Download gmp (needs gmp.h, which MSYS2 doesn't seem to supply)
lzip -d ... to unzip it
Although maybe `pacman -S gmp-devel' will work

Download and install libdb. Needs db.h. Maybe get the sourdes from cygwin,
as the installation instructions may be unclear otherwise.
